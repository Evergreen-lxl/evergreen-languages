# Language Support for Evergreen.lxl

This repository provides plugins for language support in Evergreen.

Plugins consist of query files from [`nvim-treesitter`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter),
and a shared library containing the parser and scanner if needed.

Updates from upstream are fetched daily.

# Installation

Do note that some language plugins may have dependencies on other ones.
If not using a package manager, you will have to download the plugins for them as well.

It is recommended to use a package manager if possible â€“
it greatly simplifies dealing with dependencies, and provides automatic updates.
